# Steps to run yourself:
# 1.) Request a Census API Key here: https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html
# 2.) Confirm your key via the link emailed to you (try a few minutes later if you get an error)
# 3.) Un-comment the line with the census_api_key() function. Insert your key and run the code 
#     through that point once. Then you can re-comment or delete that line.
# 4.) Update analysis_state and analysis_county to the ones you are interested in and run the rest of the code.
